# TradingKYC - Flutter-based KYC Onboarding System

## Overview

TradingKYC is a **Flutter-based KYC Onboarding System** designed for **kyc onboarding**. It ensures **regulatory compliance** by integrating **AI/ML-powered identity verification, secure document handling, and compliance checks** against **sanctions/PEP databases**.

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles using **BLoC & Riverpod** for state management, **Dio for API interactions**, and **Flutter Secure Storage** for handling sensitive user data.

## 1. System Architecture

The architecture consists of three key layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: UI screens, widgets, and state management using **BLoC/Riverpod**.
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, use cases, and entities that interact with repositories.
- **Data Layer**: API services, repositories, secure storage, and compliance checks.

## 2. Setup Instructions

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asif786ka/kyc_onboarding/.git
cd tradingkyc
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### **3. Setup Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file and add:

```env
API_BASE_URL="https://your-api.com"
AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
```

### **4. Run the Application**

```bash
flutter run
```
